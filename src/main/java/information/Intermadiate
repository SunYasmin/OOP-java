**Constructor                                                                                    **Method

It has the same name as the class.                                                               The method name and class name are not the same.

The Construcotr is a special type of method used to initialize an object of its class.           The method is a set of instructions that can be called at any time during the execution of a program.

It creates a class instance.                                                                     It's used to run Java code.

It is called implicitly when we create a class object.                                           When we explicitly call it, it is executed.

The subclass cannot inherit it.                                                                  The subclass can inherit it.

It does not have any return type.                                                                It must have a return type.

It cannot be overridden in Java.                                                                 It can be overridden in Java.

It cannot be declared static.                                                                    It can be declared static.

A constructor is provided by the Java compiler by default.                                       By default, the Java compiler does not provide any methods.




Note: Commonly asked Java OOPs interview question.


Explain different levels of data abstraction in Java.
There are three levels of data abstraction:

***Physical Level: This is the level of data abstraction that is the lowest. It demonstrates how information is kept in memory.

***Logical Level: It consists of the data kept in the database as tables.
It also stores the connections between the data entities in relatively straightforward structures.
The user's access to information at the view level is currently unknown.

***View Level: This level is the highest level of data abstraction. The user can see the real database.
It makes it easier for a single user to access the database.
